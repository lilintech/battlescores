# BattleScores
A website for students that tracks their progress in exams and helps them improve on subjects they perform poorly in.
# How It Works
- The aim of this website is to improve ones scores in subjects they don't perform well in. 
- This is done by categorizing the various subjects into different folders that are unique to track the performances.
- The marks for all the subjects in a folder are summed up to give the total marks that will be ranked with the other folders.
- It is like a game where the goal is to have the folder containing the subjects the student performs poorly in, not always be at the last folder but move towards the best folders and even be the best performed.
# Features
1. Folder that contains the subjects
2. Files that represent the subjects
3. Score Overview that user gets to see previous scores of all the subjects of the selected folder and update on current scores in the subjects.
4. Target which is on the score overview that the user can use to remind them of their set goal (each folder can have a different target depending on the student's choice)
# Recommendations
- Students are advised to have their worst subjects in one folder and balance out the other subjects e.g one average performed subject with one best performed subject in one folder. <br>
- This is to increase chances of the folders balancing out to create good competition.
