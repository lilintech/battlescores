# Funfiles
The concept behind this website is to improve one scores in subjects they don't perform well in.
This is done by categorizing the subjects into folders to track the performances.
Users are advised to have their worst subjects in one folder and balance out the other subjects e.g one average performed subject with another best performed in one folder.
This is to increase chances of moderation
it will be in a gamified way
think of duolingo etc
